## Detailed Task Requirements

### FEAT-001: Batch Approval for HR and Finance

**Description:**  
Implement a feature that allows HR and Finance users to approve multiple claims simultaneously to improve workflow efficiency.

**Requirements:**
1. Create a batch selection interface on claims approval page
2. Implement bulk approval endpoint with proper validation
3. Ensure appropriate history entries are created for each claim
4. Add batch notification functionality
5. Implement undo functionality within a 5-minute window

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Users can select multiple claims using checkboxes
- A batch approval action button appears when multiple claims are selected
- All selected claims move to the next workflow status
- Proper validation prevents claims in incompatible states from being included
- History records capture the batch approval action
- Notification messages reflect the batch action

### PERF-001: Optimize Database Queries in Dashboard

**Description:**  
The claims dashboard is experiencing slow load times due to inefficient database queries. This task involves optimizing these queries to improve performance.

**Requirements:**
1. Identify inefficient queries in the dashboard controller
2. Implement eager loading for relationships
3. Add appropriate indexes to database tables
4. Consider implementing view caching for dashboard elements
5. Benchmark performance before and after changes

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Dashboard page loads in under 1 second for up to 1000 claims
- Database query count reduced by at least 50%
- No N+1 query issues present in the code
- Optimization does not affect data integrity or accuracy

### REF-001: Refactor ClaimController

**Description:**  
The ClaimController has grown too large (>1000 lines) and needs to be refactored into smaller, more focused controllers.

**Requirements:**
1. Analyze the current controller to identify logical groupings
2. Create new controllers for each domain area (creation, approval, export, etc.)
3. Move methods to appropriate controllers
4. Update routes to point to new controller methods
5. Ensure full test coverage for the refactored code

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- No single controller exceeds 300 lines
- Controllers are organized by domain responsibility
- All functionality works identically after refactoring
- Test coverage maintained or improved
